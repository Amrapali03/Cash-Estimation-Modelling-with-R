Cash Estimation Modelling

Introduction: Understanding the pivotal role of cash holdings in shaping a firm's future performance and market dynamics is crucial in modern financial analysis. Our analysis aims to estimate optimal cash levels for individual firms. Through rigorous statistical modeling, we seek to ascertain whether companies hold surplus or inadequate cash compared to their estimated targets.

Dataset:
The data used for our analysis is sourced from the WRDS portal, specifically the Compustat - Fundamentals Annual section for the North America region, covering the period from 1960 to 2022.
